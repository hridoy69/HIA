# Integrating (Deep) Machine Learning and Cheminformatics for Predicting Human Intestinal Absorption of Small Molecules
# Overview
A set of 2648 compounds were collected from some early as well as recent works and curated to build a robust dataset. Five machine learning (ML) algorithms have been trained with a set of molecular descriptors of these compounds which have been selected after rigorous feature engineering. Additionally, a graph convolution neural network (GCNN) based model was developed using the same set of compounds to exploit the predictability with automated extracted features.  
# Findings
The numerical analyses show that out the five ML models, Random forest and LightGBM could predict with an accuracy of 87.71% and 86.04% on the test set and 95% and 89% with the external validation set respectively. Whereas with the GCNN based model, the final accuracy obtained was 74.58% and 82% on the external test set.
